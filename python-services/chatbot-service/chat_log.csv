hi doctor the nails on my right hand seem to be clubbing,hello. from your description here it seems you are troubled with the anger issues more than anything else. and the recurrence of the anger is probably a reason why you want to know if this could be bipolar disorder. however the symptoms you have described here are not sufficient to diagnose or rule out bipolar disorder. mood symptoms are prominent in bipolar disorder. usually there should be alternate periods of depression and mania/hypomania with intervening period of normal behavior and mood. there could even be two or more consecutive manic or depressive episodes. but the most important criteria is to have episodes of mania/hypomania and depression. anxiety also seems to play a major role in the emotional disturbances you might have. even without having a diagnosis for this you can start working towards improving the situation. ideally you should consult a psychiatrist for a better understanding of the situation. if that is not possible you can start with a few exercises for stress relief such as the jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation. as to the anger it is important to exercise rational thinking 'during' a situation that normally produces the anger. rational thinking can be viewed as a thinking pattern which allows you to reach your goals with minimum emotional disturbances. it needs practice and it can be learned with the help of a psychotherapist but you can certainly try it until you can manage to consult a doctor. hope this helps. abhijeet deshmukh md (this post is for the purpose of providing medical information and is not a substitute for a face-to-face consultation with a doctor. this post is not intended to give or rule out a diagnosis create a doctor-patient relationship or replace an existing one. i am not able to diagnose medical conditions online. please consult with your doctor or a qualified healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment options),2024-12-08 17:36:18

hi i am a 25 year old female with 2 young children i was diagnose with coeliec dieases 2 years ago. i have had for the past week dark blood in my stools and a swollen armpit. do you think this has something to do with the coeleic dieases also i havent stuck to the glutun free diet in over a year plz,the normal level of vitamin b12 in the blood is 200-1000ng/l. the levels of methylmalonic acid are generally high during anemia due to a lack of vitamin b12 or folic acid. methylmalonic acid can also be checked with a urine test. most hmos cover diagnostic services when medically necessary and prescribed by a participating physician. check with your insurance provider for more detailed information about your coverage.,2024-12-08 17:44:14
